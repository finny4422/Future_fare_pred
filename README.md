step:1 use the data in data.xlsx and split the data as Final_test and Final_train which is done in split_DS
step:2 use Final_train data to train the model with different algorithm i used Randomforestregressor, linear regressor, KNN, decision tree
       which is done in train_models
step:3 using hyperparameter tuning using Randomized search CV increase the accuracy 
step:4 dump these in pickle file 
step:5 use these models on test data and compare the predicctions with price coloumn in test data
